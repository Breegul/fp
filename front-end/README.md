# Front-end (Web)

- Network: collection of inter-connected things/computers
- Internet: a really big global network of networks
- Web: an information system that allows document access

## How does it work?

- Client/server model
	- Client (make requests)
	- Server (listens for and fulfills requests)
	- Roles, not mutually-exclusive
- Protocol
	- Agreed way of doing things
	- Allows each party in a transaction/interaction to just worry about their own part
- HTTP(s)
	- How we make the requests
	- How to format requests/responses
    - Different types of request
		- GET: ask for information
		- POST: send information
		- PATCH: 
		- DELETE: request the deletion of information
- Status codes
	- 2xx: success
	- 3xx: redirection
	- 4xx: client failure
	- 5xx: server failure
